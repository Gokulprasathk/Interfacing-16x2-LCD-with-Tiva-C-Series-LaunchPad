# Introduction: <br />
LCDs are widely used for displaying information in various electronic devices. Interfacing an LCD with a microcontroller like the Tiva Launchpad allows you to display text and simple graphics. This readme provides instructions on how to interface a 16x2 LCD with the Tiva Launchpad using the provided code.

# Hardware Requirements:<br />

To interface the 16x2 LCD with the Tiva Launchpad, you will need the following hardware components:

Tiva Launchpad development board (e.g., TM4C123GXL)
16x2 LCD module 
Potentiometer
Breadboard

# Software Requirements :<br />
The following software is required to compile and upload the code to the Tiva Launchpad:
KEIL IDE or any other suitable IDE for Tiva C Series microcontrollers.
TivaWareâ„¢ C Series software package provided by Texas Instruments.


# Interfacing Code:<br />
The main.c file in this repository contains the necessary code to interface the 16x2 LCD with the Tiva Launchpad. It provides functions for initializing the LCD, sending commands, and displaying text. The code uses the GPIO pins on the Tiva Launchpad to communicate with the LCD.
